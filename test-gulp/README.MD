# Test Gulp Build Process

This is an extremely simple build process put together to demonstrate the power of automated build tools using gulp. It is intended as a stepping stone for more complex build processes.

## Quick Start

```bash
$ npm install
```

To see a simple build, run:
```bash
$ gulp build
```

To see a simple build that is production ready, run
```bash
$ gulp build --production
```

To do a development build that watches for changes as they occur, run:
```bash
$ gulp watch
```
